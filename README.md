# Challenge-04

Quiz

#<Multiple questions with multiple answer option mainly Javascript>

## Description

What was my motivation?
   Building  the quiz site  involves hands-on practice with HTML, CSS and mainly JavaScript. 
    

Why did I build the project?
   The main reason was to better the learnt skills in class and demonstrate the capacity to put them to use 

Language used
   In the main functionality JavaScript has almost everything involved in this project, in addition the use of a basic HTML and a somewhat moderate use of CSS for the styling and effects.

What did I learn?
    Although it may not run as expected I was able to play with a different tool being JavaScript.
